1.Connect the 50-pin cable from the ColdFire microprocessor to your
breadboard. 

NTR

2.Get the lab2.zip file from the eClass course website. 

NTR

3.Create a new project called lab2 in your ECE 315 workspace. 
Follow the same procedure as you did in the tutorial.

NTR

4.Unzip and import all of the files into your project and delete the
main.cpp file before building your project. 

NTR

5.Run the project and check the heartbeat and context switching 
pins (J2[3]and J2[4]). 
Verify that the default webpage is being served. 

default webpage shown: ``The main page for the lab2 project. ``

probe rounded to breadboard
used jumper wire on breadboard to easily probe pins
pin heartbeat j2[3]: both straight line 3.35v
pin context switch j2[4]: both straight line

6.We will be using the LCD for output in this lab. 
Please remember that the encoder, multiplexor, and the LCD use 3.3V. 
Using the wrong voltage may damage the board.


7.Please note that at this point none of your keypad hardware will
work as expected. You need to complete exercise three to see the 
keypad working.
