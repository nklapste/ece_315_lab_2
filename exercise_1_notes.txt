1. DO NOT connect the 50-pin ribbon cable between the ColdFire board
and your breadboard just yet. Connect 3.3V from the power supply to
power the encoder. You will start by taking measurements while 
unconnected to the ColdFire board. 

NTR

2.Consult the oscilloscope user manual for instructions on how to 
do single shot capture. You will also need to make use of the 
measuring cursors to complete the following two measurements. 

to obtain a manual we used the first *.pdf obtained from googling
the oscilloscope unit number.


3.You will be measuring some timing characteristics of the encoder
using the oscilloscope. The Y lines coming into the encoder via 
the keypad are normally pulled high. Once any button is pressed, 
the Y line is driven low, the Data Available line is driven high
and the output lines are driven with the number of the button that
was pressed (0-15). Measure the time between any of the Y lines 
going low and the Data Available line going high. 

confused mux for encoder on sheet should be noted

MM encoder
74 mux



y line: 41 - channel 1 -> y1
Data available: DA - 12: channel 2 -> da


y1 drop to DA up delay was about: 18.40ms (other go ~16ms)

4.Measure the time when the Data Available line goes low between
two consecutive button presses. Generate this scenario by pressing
a button and then pressing a second button without releasing the 
first button. Now release the first button and measure how long 
the Data Available line is low. Take several readings and record
the minimum and maximum for all of the presses.

##first go:
first max ch2 DA 0ms
first min ch1 y  17ms
first min ch2 DA 6.4ms
second max ch1 y 16ms

##second go:
first max ch2 DA 0ms
first min ch1 y  16.4ms
first min ch2 DA 7.2ms
second max ch1 y 16ms

##third go:
first max ch2 DA 0ms
first min ch1 y  16.4ms
first min ch2 DA 1.2ms
second max ch1 y 14ms


5.Compare the expected values from the MM74C922 data sheet. 
Do your measured results match with the expected results? 
Discuss this in your report.
