1.The four corner keys will be mapped to four separate functions:
 * up
 * down
 * left
 * right
The movement of the sprite should be bounded by the outer edge 
of the LCD meaning at no time should the display of the characters 
rollover. Pressing the up, down, left and right keys when the box 
is at the edge should result in no change to the display. 


2.During the demo, the lab instructor will ask for your key layout
for testing.


3.The other 12 buttons on the keypad should be ignored.
